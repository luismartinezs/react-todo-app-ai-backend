# Todo App Backend

This is the backend for a todo app that stores and retrieves todos from a database. The backend is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Endpoints

The backend exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/todos`: Retrieves a list of all todos
- `POST /api/todos`: Creates a new todo
- `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Updates an existing todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Deletes an existing todo

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/luismartinezs/react-todo-app-ai-backend.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

3. Start the server:

```
pnpm start
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

This app was built with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), a large language model trained by OpenAI. ChatGPT provided guidance and assistance throughout the development process.

I hope this `README.md` file helps you understand the backend of the todo app and get started with it. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
